# EGRFC Playbook 2025/26

Welcome to the official EGRFC playbook for the 2025/26 season. 

This playbook serves as an illustrative guide to the club's playing style, principles, and strategies. It is designed to be a living document that will evolve as we learn and grow throughout the season.

The playbook is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of our game. We encourage all players and coaches to familiarise themselves with the content and contribute to its development through continuous feedback.
