# Restarts

## 1-4-1-3 formation

Forwards cover one side of the pitch while backs are spread across the other as shown, with the scrum half in a position to either follow a forward carry, or spread the ball wide.

If the kick goes deep, the forwards carry short for 2 or 3 phases towards the 15m line and get into position for a box kick and chase.

If the ball is caught cleanly outside the 22m, the scrum half is waiting behind to feed the backs running into space on the opposite side of the pitch.

With all the forwards on one side of the pitch, the backs are expected to clear the first ruck

The example below demonstrates how the forwards can set the [3-3-2](../attack/index.md#3-3-2-structure) pattern for the following phases.
