# Restarts

We no longer split the pitch with forwards on one side, mirroring the opposition who we expect to do the same. Instead, we set up symmetrically with forwards and backs on both sides of the pitch.

This gives us clear options and individual roles, wherever the ball is kicked:
- **Carry** - Between the 10m and 22m lines, left and right sides of the pitch are each covered by a prop, a second row and a flanker, ready to carry and support each other. The hooker covers the middle, directly in front of the kicker.
- **Run** - Deeper kicks into the 22m leave more space to run the ball back, so this area is covered by the wings and centres, with the Number 8 in the middle.
- **Kick** - Deep into our 22m, 10 and 15 are ready to kick to exit, with the scrum half in the middle to pass the ball to either of them.
