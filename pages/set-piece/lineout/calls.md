# Setups & Calls
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

This section covers how we line up for a lineout (number of players and their positions), and how we communicate the target jumper and movements involved in a lineout to the players involved.

We assume no more than 3 strong jumpers in the lineout, one of whom is the caller (usually the middle jumper).

## Formations

We run a 5-man lineout by default, but also 7-man and 4-man lineout variations. Each of these can be set up with many different formations (e.g. 1-3-2-1 or 1-1-3) so we need to keep things simple, but flexible.

| :----------- | :---------------- | 
| **Squeeze** | A middle pod[^1] is pre-set as a quick option ("Bang") or to draw in the defence before executing a movement. _**This is our default setup**_ | 
| **Spread**   | Players are spaced out across the lineout. This gives the defence no clear focal point, so we can attack wherever is least well defended, or back ourselves to beat a mirror defence with speed of execution.   | 
| **Split**    | Pods are split between front and back, creating space to attack in the middle, either using movement during the lineout or moving the ball quickly away  |

## Calls

### Target zones

Given we rarely have more than 3 strong jumpers in the lineout, and to keep options relatively simple, we divide the 10m lineout channel into 3 zones (1, 2, 3), each with a corresponding target jumper.

{: .info .fs-3}
> These zones also leave us with a no-jump option (**0**) at the front of the lineout (i.e. "Matlow")

So a simple call might be: 

- **"7-man Squeeze 3"**
  - 2-3-2 formation 
  - "Bang" option to the middle pod
  - Target jumper is the back pod (3)
  
### Dummies

To beat the defence, we can use dummy jumps to draw defenders to one area and then quickly jump elsewhere before they can reorganise. Using the numbering system above, we can call a dummy jump by simply putting one number after another.

For example, the old "RD" call could now be called **"12"**:

- Dummy jump at the front (1), followed by
- a throw to the middle (2)

This commits the defence before throwing over them to a stronger attacking position further back.

### Steps

Rather than commit to a dummy jump and multiple movements, we can also simply call to a target pod moving forward (**"+"**) or backwards (**"-"**)from its starting position.

This is useful if our pod is being marked closely, as it allows us to specifically train and call for a decisive movement of the whole pod to get in front or behind the defence.

For example, against a 5-man mirror defence, we might call **"2+"** to give us the option for the middle pod to take a quick step forward to get in front of the defence before jumping, to jump immediately (on "Bang").
