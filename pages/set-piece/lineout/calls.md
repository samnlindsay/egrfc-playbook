# Setups & Calls
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

This section covers our lineout structure (player numbers and positions) and how we communicate the target jumper and movement.

We typically have up to 3 strong jumpers, with the caller usually in the middle.

## Formations

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/formations.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

We run a 5-man lineout by default, but also 7-man and 4-man lineout variations. Each of these can be set up with many different formations (e.g. 1-3-2-1 or 1-1-3) so we need to keep things simple, but flexible.

| :----------- | :---------------- | 
| **Squeeze** | A pre-set middle pod[^1] is ready for a quick "Bang" or to draw in the defence before moving. _**Default setup**_ | 
| **Spread** | Evenly spaced, keeping the defence guessing so we can attack weak spots or win with speed. | 
| **Split** | Pods at front and back create space in the middle for movement or quick delivery. | 

[^1]: Or back pod in the case of the 4-man version.

## Calls

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/target-jumper.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

We divide the lineout into 3 zones (**1**, **2**, **3**), each with a jumper, or **0** for the very front with no jump (i.e. "Matlow").

{: .example .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **"7-man Squeeze 3"**
> 
> Initial 2-3-2 formation. Throw to the back (3) on **"Set"**. Throw to the middle pod on **"Bang"**.

### Dummies
{: .no_toc }

To mislead the defence, we use dummy jumps. Call two numbers in sequence â€” the first is the dummy, the second is the real target.

{: .example .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **"1 2"**
> 
> Dummy at the front (1), throw to middle (2). Similar to the old "RD", or "Canterbury 3".

### Steps
{: .no_toc }

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/target-with-steps.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

We can call slight forward (**"+"**) or backward (**"-"**) movements to adjust pod position and beat tight marking.

{: .example .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **"2+"**
> 
> Middle pod steps forward to gain position. Can still jump on "Bang" if needed.
