# Calls
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

This section covers how we define the target jumper and movements involved in a lineout, and how we communicate them to the players involved.

# Calling process

When the huddle is called, the lineout caller will give the formation, call and play to the lineout players. Everyone now knows how to set up and what movements are expected. 

As everyone gets into position, the caller triggers the move by shouting **"Set"**. This coordinates the timing for everyone, allowing for quick, controlled movements.

Every lineout will also have a **"Bang"** option, which is a quick option to override the call if needed. This is a throw to the pre-set middle or back pod (depending on the formation), in case it is a safer option given the defence's setup.

Alternatively, if the "Bang" option is insufficient, the caller can call "Cancel" followed by a new call, pausing to allow the players to reset before calling "Set". This is the only time the opposition gets to hear our calls, but if only used infrequently it gives us full flexibility to respond to defensive changes during a game.

# Call components



## Target zones

Given we rarely have more than 3 strong jumpers in the lineout, and to keep options relatively simple, we divide the 10m lineout channel into 3 zones (1, 2, 3), each with a corresponding target jumper.

{: .info .fs-3}
> These zones also leave us with a no-jump option (**0**) at the front of the lineout (i.e. "Matlow")

So a simple call might be: 

- **"7-man Squeeze 3"**
  - 2-3-2 formation 
  - "Bang" option to the middle pod
  - Target jumper is the back pod (3)

## Dummies

To beat the defence, we can use dummy jumps to draw defenders to one area and then quickly jump elsewhere before they can reorganise. Using the numbering system above, we can call a dummy jump by simply putting one number after another.

For example, the old "RD" call could now be called **"12"**:

- Dummy jump at the front (1), followed by
- a throw to the middle (2)

This commits the defence before throwing over them to a stronger attacking position further back.

## Steps

Rather than commit to a dummy jump and multiple movements, we can also simply call to a target pod moving forward (**"+"**) or backwards (**"-"**)from its starting position.

This is useful if our pod is being marked closely, as it allows us to specifically train and call for a decisive movement of the whole pod to get in front or behind the defence.

For example, against a 5-man mirror defence, we might call **"2+"** to give us the option for the middle pod to take a quick step forward to get in front of the defence before jumping, to jump immediately (on "Bang").
