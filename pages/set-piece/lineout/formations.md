# Formations

This section covers how we line up for a lineout, including how many players are in the lineout and how they are positioned.
It is how we paint a picture for the defence and create options for our attack. 

We run a 5-man by default, but also 7-man and 4-man variations.

Each of these can be run in different formations:

| :----------- | :---------------- | 
| **Squeeze**  _(default)_ | A middle pod[^1] is pre-set as a quick option ("Bang") or to draw in the defence before executing a movement | 
| **Spread**   | Players are spaced out across the lineout. This gives the defence no clear focal point, so we can attack wherever is least well defended, or back ourselves to beat a mirror defence with speed of execution.   | 
| **Split**    | Pods are split between front and back, creating space to attack in the middle, either using movement during the lineout or moving the ball quickly away  | 

Assuming 3 jumpers, these formations can be represented as:

> Our default formation is a **"Squeeze"** (for 4- 5- or 7-man lineouts).
> 
> The others will be introduced as needed, but we should be careful not to over-complicate things.
