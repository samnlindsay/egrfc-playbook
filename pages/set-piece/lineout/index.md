# Lineout

Both teams have 10-20 attacking lineouts per game, giving them the opportunity to set up an attack from a controlled platform.

{: .attack .fs-5 }
> On our own ball, everything we do should be focused on these two questions:
>
> 1. How do we **beat the defence** to win the ball?
> 2. How do we **break the gain line** and create a scoring opportunity?


{: .defence .fs-5 }
>On the opposition ball, we do the opposite:
>
> 1. How do we force a turnover? (either forcing an error or stealing the ball)
> 2. How do we cut off their attacking options?

## Attacking options

Each lineout can be summarised by:

- [**Formation**](/lineout/formations/) - how many players and how they are positioned (e.g. 1-3-1, equal spaces, etc.)
- [**Call**](/lineout/calls/) - how different movements are defined and communicated among the players
- [**Play**](/lineout/plays/) - how the ball is delivered from the lineout (e.g. off the top, driving maul, etc.)

{: .info .fs-3}
> Unless otherwise stated, the default setup is a **5-man "Squeeze"** (1-3-1 formation) with a quick option ("Bang") to override the call and throw straight to the middle

> If in doubt, this is a safe place to start. If the defence is putting us under pressure, we will can vary the formation, the calls or the numbers to support a driving maul or different plays the backs want to run.


## How a lineout is formed
We pre-call our lineouts to give players a good idea of what is going to happen, and to avoid giving the defence any clues. This means we need to decide quickly and communicate early. This is done by the lineout caller (usually the main jumper) and the backs leader (usually the 10).

The forwards involved in the lineout form a quick huddle as soon as the ball is dead (except the hooker, who is getting the ball). The lineout caller will then call the formation and play, and the forwards will break out to their positions. 

9 and 10 can similarly organise the backs and any additional forwards who are not in the lineout.
