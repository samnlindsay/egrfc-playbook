This section covers our setup, how we call the throw and any movements in the lineout, and then how we play the ball away from the lineout.

# Formations &nbsp; <span class="badge-new">NEW</span>

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/formations.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

We run a 5-man lineout by default, but also 7-man and 4-man lineout variations. Each of these can be set up with many different formations (e.g. 1-3-2-1 or 1-1-3) so we need to keep things simple, but flexible.

| :----------- | :---------------- | 
| **Squeeze** | A pre-set middle pod[^1] is ready for a quick "Bang" or to draw in the defence before moving. _**Default setup**_ | 
| **Spread** | Evenly spaced, keeping the defence guessing so we can attack weak spots or win with speed. | 
| **Split** | Pods at front and back create space in the middle for movement or quick delivery. | 

[^1]: Or back pod in the case of the 4-man version.

# Calls &nbsp; <span class="badge-new">NEW</span>

We divide the lineout into 3 zones (**1**, **2**, **3**), each with a jumper, or **0** for the very front with no jump (i.e. "Matlow").

{: .blue-title .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **Example**
> 
> **"7-man Squeeze 3"**
> 
> Initial 2-3-2 formation. Throw to the back (3) on **"Set"**. Throw to the middle pod on **"Bang"**.

## Dummy jumps
{: .no_toc }

To mislead the defence, we use dummy jumps. Call two numbers in sequence — the first is the dummy, the second is the real target.

{: .blue-title .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **Example**
> 
> **"1 2"**
> 
> Dummy at the front (1), throw to middle (2). Similar to the old "RD", or "Canterbury 3".

## Steps
{: .no_toc}

We can call slight forward ("**+**") or backward ("**--**") movements to adjust pod position and beat tight marking.

{: .blue-title .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **Example**
> 
> **"2+"**
> 
> Middle pod steps forward to gain position. Can still jump on "Bang" if needed.

# Plays

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/plays.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

The final part of the lineout is how we play the ball once it has been secured. Broadly, this is split into two categories: 

1. **Hot** (give the ball to the backs)
2. **Cold** (keep the ball in the forwards - set up a maul)
  - **Transfer** - pass the ball down to another forward in the lineout to shift the initial point of contact for the maul
  - **Flyby** - bring the ball to ground for a maul before the forward receiver peels off to carry


## Hot

If the backs ask for a **Hot** ball, the jumper passes directly to the scrum half, who can play the ball as determined by the backs (e.g. a [Backs Move](../../../attack/backs) or [King or Queen](../../../attack/forwards#king---pod-off-9) off a short lineout).

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/hot.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

## Cold

If the backs ask for a **Cold** ball, the standard option is for the jumper to be brought down to ground, and the forwards to set up a maul on that spot.

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/cold.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

{: .red-title .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **Note**
> 
> The forward at the back of the maul acts effectively as a number 8 in a scrum (see [Plays off scrum](../../scrum#plays-off-scrum-or-maul)) so the scrum half may call a move.
> 
> **These moves are not part of the lineout call**


The jumper can also pass the ball down to another forward in the lineout to shift the initial point of contact for the maul (**Transfer**). This is useful if the defence is expecting a maul to be set up in a particular place, or if the jumper is being closely marked, allowing us to initiate the drive in a weaker defensive position.

</details>


## Flyby

With the same setup as a **Cold** ball, the jumper can bring the ball to ground, but for another forward to peel off and carry (see [Plays off scrum](../../scrum#plays-off-scrum-or-maul--new)).

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/lineout/flyby.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

For simplicity, the ball carrier should expect to pass to the 9 (i.e. [♣️ **Clubs**](../../scrum#️-clubs) or [♦️ **Diamonds**](../../scrum#️-diamonds)), but other forwards in the lineout should follow the play and be ready to support the ball carrier.

{: .red-title .fs-4 .lh-tight}
> **Note**
> 
> **Flyby** is a forward-led play, but requires the backs to be expecting it so they can be ready to run their lines off the ball carrier peeling off, so it's not strictly a **Hot** or **Cold** play.
>
> **Only run it when the backs have asked for it (or been told to expect it)**

## Short lineouts

If **Hot** is called, a short lineout leaves 2 or 3 forwards to be used in the back line. 

For **Cold** lineouts, we need one of those extra forwards in the receiver (scrum half) position, because there are fewer unused forwards ready to support the lifting pod.

This "+1" player can also unlock some more complex movements, particularly using the **Split** formation to challenge the defence.
