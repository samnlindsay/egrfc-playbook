A summary of the key words and phrases used in the lineout.

|  **Spread** | Even spacings between players |
|  **Split** | Split across front and back pods with space in the middle (i.e. 3-1-3 or 3-2) |

| :-------- | :---------- |

### [Target + Movements](../attack#calls--new)

How we identify the target jumper and any required movements.

| :-------- | :---------- |
| **0** | No-jump option to front |

| _"Plus"_/_"Minus"_ **(+/-)** | Pod [steps](../attack#steps) forwards (e.g. **"2+"**) or backwards (e.g. **"1-"**) |
| **123** (or any other combination) | A series of [dummy jumps](../attack#dummy-jumps) (e.g. `31` is a dummy at the back before throwing to the front, or `1- 2` (_"one minus, two"_) is a dummy to the front pod stepping backwards, and then a throw to the middle pod) |

### [During the lineout](../#calling-process)

|  **Flyby** | Bring the ball to ground for a maul before the receiver peels off to carry in the open |

### [Defence](../defence)

Defensive key words to describe our defensive setup, or that of our opposition.
