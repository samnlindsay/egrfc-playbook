# Summary

| _"Plus"_ **(+)** | Pod steps forwards (e.g. `2+` = middle pod stepping forwards) |
| _"Minus"_ **(-)** | Pod steps backwards (e.g. `1-` = front pod stepping backwards) |
| **123** (or any other combination) | Dummy jump in the corresponding positions before throwing to the last number (e.g. `31` is a dummy at the back before throwing to the front, or `1- 2` (_"one minus, two"_) is a dummy to the front pod stepping backwards, and then a throw to the middle pod) |
