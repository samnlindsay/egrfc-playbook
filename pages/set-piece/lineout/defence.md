# Defence

Lineout defence is as important as attack, and doing it well is even more difficult. In attack, you know what is going to happen and you have a head start. In defence, you have to be prepared for anything and move quickly. A defence only functions if the players act together as a unit, and everyone is clear about their role.

## Static defences

In recent years, we have rarely discussed or trained lineout defence, so we have generally used one of 3 static defences - with 2 pods (**"2 Towers"**), 1 pod (**"Jack 1 Murder"**) or no pods (**"Murder"**) set in position ready to compete.

Generally, these defences are easy for the opposition to read and call appropriately. Teams often run a 5-man lineout to avoid the "2 Towers" option, and the others are negated by throwing to the middle/back, off the top or using a shift drive ("Transfer").

## Dynamic defences

A more potent defence requires multiple players to be ready to react, make decisions and move within the lineout. This requires a lot of practice, and awareness of each other's roles.
