# Defence

Lineout defence is harder than attack — you react without knowing the plan. Success depends on everyone working together with clear roles.

## Static defences

In recent years, we’ve mainly used 3 static setups:

- **"2 Towers"**: 2 pods ready to contest
- **"Jack 1 Murder"**: 1 pod
- **"Murder"**: No pods

These are predictable and easy to counter. Opponents often use 5-man lineouts or quick throws to avoid or beat them (e.g. to the back, off the top, or with a shift drive).

## Dynamic defences

Stronger defence involves coordinated, reactive movement by multiple players. This demands training, quick decisions, and clear understanding of roles:

- **"Mirror"** - each player marks their opposite man, mirroring their movements in anticipation of having a jumper ready to compete in the air
- **"Hinge"** - jumpers mark their own area and a "hinge" player stands between them. This is the most challenging role as he must react to the opposition's movement and commit to lifting one of the jumpers.
