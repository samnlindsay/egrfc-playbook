# Scrum

## 3-3-2 structure

Once the scrum is complete, we should aim to establish our [3-3-2](../attack/index.md#3-3-2-structure) pattern quickly as we transition to open phase play, led by the number 8 and flankers.

Typically, the ball will be played through the backs, with 8 and 7 expected to follow the play and secure the first ruck. The remaining forwards form two pods of 3.
