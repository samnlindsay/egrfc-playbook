## 3-3-2 structure

Once the scrum is complete, we should aim to establish our [3-3-2](../../attack#3-3-2-structure) pattern quickly as we transition to open phase play, led by the number 8 and flankers.

Typically, the ball will be played through the backs, with 8 and 7 expected to follow the play and secure the first ruck. The remaining forwards form two pods of 3.

## Plays off scrum (or maul) &nbsp; <span class="badge-new">NEW</span>

The ball is usually played away from a scrum or maul by the scrum half, where the backs can run a pre-planned [backs move](../../attack/backs).

The alternative is for the 8 to pick up the ball at the back of the scrum (or the player at the back of a maul) and carry it forward, drawing in defenders around the scrum (or maul) before passing to the backs.

We have 3 pre-called moves in this situation, which can be called before the scrum (or once a maul has stopped): ♠️ **Spades**, ♣️ **Clubs** , and ♦️ **Diamonds**

### ♠️ Spades

Ball carrier has 2 passing options:

- 12 on a short line, looking to break the gain line
- 11 round the back of 12, spreading the ball wide to 13 and creating an overlap

### ♣️ Clubs

Much like **Spades** but through the 9 first, looking for more width:
- 11, 12 and 13 running the same lines
- 10 offers a second out-the-back option behind 13

### ♦️ Diamonds

Prioritising width, aiming for the edge by passing the ball behind more direct-running centres:
- The forward runner _can_ take contact, or pass to 12 on a short line, but the primary option is...
- 9 taking the ball wide behind 12 
- 10 taking the ball wide behind 13 (a back-up option)
- 14 taking the ball to the edge behind 15 (a back-up option)
