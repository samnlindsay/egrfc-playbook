# Attack

## Pod structure

Each forward pod consists of 3 players in an L shape:

- **"Lead"** looks to take the ball off 9 or 10 and carry
- **"Link"** is close on his outside to support the carry or take a flat tip pass
- **"Pull"** sits behind "Lead" tracking across to support either ball carrier or to take a pull back pass

### Backs joining pods
{: .no_toc}

<div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/attack/2pod.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

In the 3-3-2 structure, one pod only has two forwards, so a back needs to fill the **"Pull"** role, supporting the forward ball carriers, or being released down the wing.

</div>

There is no longer a "Captain of Play" expected behind every pod, allowing the backs more freedom. 

A back can still step into that role and call **"Take off"** for the ball to be passed behind the advancing pod for the backs to go wide.

## Pod plays

Pods can be placed in different areas of the field relative to the previous ruck as below:

### **King** - pod off 9

**Lead** takes the ball at pace off 9, aiming outside the C defender.

### **Queen** - pod off 10

Identical shape as a **King** but set deeper and wider, receiving the ball from 10 and looking to find a gap in the defence, choosing from one of the above options.

# Defence

## Defensive line

Priority is to secure the A/B/C positions. The 9 can sweep behind the ruck to organise, while the open side winger joins as the 13th defender, with the other winger and 15 dropping deep.

Our defensive will be speed off the line and communicated from the inside man.

| :-------- | :---------- |
| Starting Position | inside your opposite player |
| A-B-C | **A** is Post, **B** is the link man and **C** is inside first defender |
| Check, Move | Look across the defensive line and go forward |
| Push | Inside man has the player and you can focus on next player outside of the ball |
| Concede | Drift defence where we are short of players and concede ground until numbers are on our side |

## Tackle Language

| :-------- | :---------- |
| Approach | Adjust your position and approach to increase the opportunity of a successful tackle |
| Contact | Make a positive initial contact with opponent ensuring transfer throughout the tackle. |

## Breakdown Language
