# Pod Structure
<!-- ![alt text](/assets/images/pod.png) -->
1. Forwards form an arrowhead shape with a “**Lead**” runner providing a clear target for the half backs
2. "**Plus**” / “**Minus**” runners are ready to clear the next ruck or provide passing options
3. A “**Captain of Play**” (usually a back) sits behind the pod to direct the play (a simple carry unless called otherwise)

We generally assume the **Lead** will carry into contact, but all 4 members of a pod must be prepared to receive the ball:
- **Lead** carries into contact
- **Lead** tips the ball to **Plus** or **Minus** to carry
- “Release” - **Lead** pulls the ball back to the **COP** 
- “Take-off” - pass behind the forward pod, directly to the **COP**
