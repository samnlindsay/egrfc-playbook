# Forward Pods

<!-- We generally assume the **Lead** will carry into contact, but all 3 members of a pod must be prepared to receive the ball:

**Lead** carries into contact
**Lead** tips the ball to **Plus**
**Lead** pulls the ball back to **Minus**  -->
<!-- - “Take-off” - pass behind the forward pod, directly to the **COP** -->

- 1/2/3 options
- Playmakers (optional)
  - tip back inside
  - take off
  - others?
