## Pod structure &nbsp; <span class="badge-new">NEW</span>

Each forward pod consists of 3 players in an L shape:

- **"Lead"** looks to take the ball off 9 or 10 and carry
- **"Link"** is close on his outside to support the carry or take a flat tip pass
- **"Pull"** sits behind "Lead" tracking across to support either ball carrier or to take a pull back pass

As last season, these 3 options can be quickly communicated as **"1"** (carry), **"2"** (tip) and **"3"** (release)

### Backs joining pods

<div style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 20px;">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/attack/2pod.png' | relative_url }}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

In the 3-3-2 structure, one pod only has two forwards, so a back needs to fill the **"Pull"** role, supporting the forward ball carriers, or being released down the wing.

</div>

There is no longer a "Captain of Play" expected behind every pod, allowing the backs more freedom. 

A back can still step into that role and call **"Take off"** for the ball to be passed behind the advancing pod for the backs to go wide.

## Pod plays

Pods can be placed in different areas of the field relative to the previous ruck as below:

### **King** - pod off 9

**Lead** takes the ball at pace off 9, aiming outside the C defender.

### **Queen** - pod off 10

Identical shape as a **King** but set deeper and wider, receiving the ball from 10 and looking to find a gap in the defence, choosing from one of the above options.

### **Ace** - short punch off 9 &nbsp; <span class="badge-renamed">RENAMED</span>

- 3 players in the ruck, 3 on their feet (2-pod available elsewhere)
- 9 pops the ball to the **Lead** runner
- Aim for B defender’s outside shoulder
- Repeat x 3 (same direction)
- Expect a “Release” on the 3rd phase. **Lead** runner pulls the ball back before contact
