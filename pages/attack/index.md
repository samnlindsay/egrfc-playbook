## 3-3-2 structure

In open play, we structure our game around a 3-3-2 pattern of forwards, with the backs playing "heads up" behind/between these forward pods.

Expect the backs to play to an edge and the forwards form pods of 3 spread across the pitch. The 2-pod (usually on the opposite edge) requires a back to fill in the support role at the back of the pod.
