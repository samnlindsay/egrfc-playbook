    "content": "When the huddle is called, the lineout caller will give the formation, call and play to the lineout players. Everyone now knows how to set up and what movements are expected. In the huddle, the caller gives the formation, call, and play. Once in position, they trigger the move with “Set”, syncing everyone’s timing. Every lineout includes a “Bang” option — a quick throw to a pre-set pod (middle or back), if needed. If “Bang” isn’t viable, the caller can say “Cancel”, give a new call, allow players to reset, then use “Set”. ",
